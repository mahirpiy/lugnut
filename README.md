## Lugnut

Lugnut is a tool for managing your vehicle maintenance records. I built it because I was tired of using Excel to manage my vehicle maintenance records and needed a new side project to play with. Money would be cool so I might monetize this in some way. If you're actually reading this on GitHub (email mahir@piyarali.io with the subject line "Lugnut2025") and I'll give you all the paid features for free.
